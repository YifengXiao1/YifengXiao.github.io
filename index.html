<p>Hello, I’m Yifeng Xiao. I’m working as a <a href="http://www.sribd.cn/en/teacher/415" target="_blank">Research Scientist at Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data (SRIBD)</a>. I received my PhD degree in the area of <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/research/process-systems.html" target="_blank">Process Systems Engineering</a> at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020, and my PhD thesis was focused on supply chain modeling and algorithms as well as global optimization. My current research interests include integer programming, global optimization, learning to optimize and grid optimization. I have publications in Journal of Global Optimization, EJOR, ICLR, etc. I won the first place in the primal track of NeurIPS 2021 ML2CO competition and the second place in the 2022 RAS Problem Solving Competition of INFORMS. Besides, I served as reviewers for journals such as IPCO, EJOR, Networks.</p>

<p>In this website, you can know more about my research and experience. 
Also, please feel free to check out my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TyYzzmoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao" target="_blank">Google Scholar</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yifengxiao1ang/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.</p>
